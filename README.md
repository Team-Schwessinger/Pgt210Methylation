"Genome stability in Puccinia graminis tritici (Pgt 21-0) with a focus on DNA repair, DNA methylation and its intrinsic relationship with gene expression and transposable elements"  

This work was supervised by Dr. Benjamin Schwessinger, Dr. Jana Sperschneider, and Dr. Ashley Jones.

Part of this work is now included in the preprint entitled "The stem rust fungus Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici induces centromeric small RNAs during late infection that direct genome-wide DNA methylation" found here https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/469338v3.
