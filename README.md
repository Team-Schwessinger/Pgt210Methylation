"Genome stability in Puccinia graminis tritici (Pgt 21-0) with a focus on DNA repair, DNA methylation and its intrinsic relationship with gene expression and transposable elements"  

This work was supervised by Dr. Benjamin Schwessinger, Dr. Jana Sperschneider, and Dr. Ashley Jones.

Part of this work is now included in the preprint entitled "The stem rust fungus Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici induces centromeric small RNAs during late infection that direct genome-wide DNA methylation" found here https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/469338v3.  

More specifically, the following folders contain parts of the methylation analysis related to the preprint:  
* methylation_analysis_data_prep
* methylation_calling
* multi_to_single_fast5_mapped_ids  

In regards to the preprint and journal publications please follow the following contributions for these specific analyses.
This analysis was lead by Dr. Benjamin Schwessinger with contributions by Ms. Jamila Nasim. DNA sequences was performed by Dr. Ashley Jones with contributions by Ms. Jamila Nasim.
